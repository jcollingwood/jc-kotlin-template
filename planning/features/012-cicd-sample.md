# Feature: CI/CD Sample

- **Status:** To Do
- **Author:** joel
- **Date:** 2025-07-25

## 1. Goal

To create a full continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the application.

## 2. Description

This feature will build upon the existing CI pipeline to create a full CI/CD pipeline. This will involve automating the deployment of the application to a staging or production environment after a successful build and test run. This will help to ensure that the application is always in a deployable state and that new features can be released quickly and reliably.

*As a developer, I want a fully automated CI/CD pipeline so that I can release new features to users with minimal manual intervention.*

## 3. Tasks

- [ ] Create a staging environment.
- [ ] Automate the deployment of the application to the staging environment.
- [ ] Add automated smoke tests to the staging environment.
- [ ] Create a production environment.
- [ ] Automate the deployment of the application to the production environment.

## 4. Technical Notes & Considerations

- The CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using GitHub Actions.
- The deployment will be done using Docker Compose.

## 5. Open Questions

- What is the desired deployment strategy (e.g., blue-green, canary)?
