# Feature: UI Framework and Component Samples

- **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal

To establish the front-end architecture using a Multi-Page Application (MPA) pattern with Ktor and Kotlinx.html, enhanced with HTMX for dynamic interactions, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Description

This feature involved setting up the core UI framework. Standard web pages were built using Ktor's HTML DSL to create a server-rendered MPA. HTMX was integrated to provide dynamic, client-side behaviors without complex JavaScript. Tailwind CSS was configured and used for all styling to ensure a consistent and modern look and feel.

*As a developer, I want a robust UI foundation so that I can build new pages and components efficiently.*

## 3. Tasks

- [x] Configure Ktor to serve HTML pages using the Kotlinx.html DSL.
- [x] Create sample MPA pages.
- [x] Integrate the HTMX library and create example components.
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS for styling.
- [x] Build a set of standard, reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards).

## 4. Technical Notes & Considerations

- The combination of Ktor (server-side rendering) and HTMX (declarative partial page loads) creates a powerful and simple stack for building modern web applications.
- Tailwind CSS is managed via a `tailwind.config.js` and a build process to generate the final `jc_styles.css`.

## 5. Open Questions

- None
