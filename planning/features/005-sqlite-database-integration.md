- **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal

To integrate a persistent database using SQLite, managed by Flyway migrations, and accessed via a repository pattern within the server.

## 2. Description

This feature established the database layer of the application. It involved configuring the server to connect to a local SQLite database file. Flyway was set up to automate database schema creation and evolution, ensuring a consistent and version-controlled database structure. A repository pattern was implemented to abstract database queries, providing a clean interface for the rest of the server to interact with the data.

*As a developer, I want a reliable and automated database setup so that I can build features that require data persistence.*

## 3. Tasks

- [x] Add SQLite JDBC driver and Flyway dependencies.
- [x] Configure the database connection properties.
- [x] Set up the Flyway migration process to run on application startup.
- [x] Create the initial database schema using a V1 migration script.
- [x] Implement the repository pattern for data access.
- [x] Integrate repository calls into the web server processes.

## 4. Technical Notes & Considerations

- The database connection is managed within the Ktor application lifecycle.
- Flyway migrations are located in the `src/main/resources/db/sqlite/migrations` directory.
- The repository pattern helps decouple business logic from data access logic.

## 5. Open Questions

- None
