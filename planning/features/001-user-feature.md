- **Status:** In Progress

## 1. Goal

To map an authenticated user session to a user in the database, enabling user-specific data and experiences within the
application.

## 2. Description

This feature will handle the creation and management of user accounts. When a user first authenticates, a corresponding
user record will be created in the database. On subsequent logins, the session will be tied to the existing user record.
This will allow for personalized content and user-specific actions.

*As a user, I want to have my session associated with a persistent user account so that I can see my data and have a
personalized experience.*

## 3. Tasks

- [x] Update user database schema
- [x] Update user repository
- [x] Create a new user record upon first session authentication
- [x] Associate subsequent logins with the existing user record
- [x] Display user details in the UI
- [ ] Imporved Login/Logout functionality
- [ ] Create an admin page for user management

## 4. Technical Notes & Considerations

- Need to decide on a strategy for linking sessions to users (e.g., using a unique identifier from the auth provider).
- The user creation process should be robust and handle potential race conditions.

## 5. Open Questions

- How should we handle cases where a user's details change in the authentication provider?
- What level of detail should be displayed on the user management page?
