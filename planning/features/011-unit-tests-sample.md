- **Status:** To Do

## 1. Goal

To establish a unit testing framework and provide example tests for different parts of the application.

## 2. Description

This feature will introduce a unit testing framework (e.g., JUnit, Kotest) and provide a set of example tests. These tests will demonstrate how to test different components of the application, such as repositories, services, and UI components. This will help ensure the quality and correctness of the code.

*As a developer, I want to write unit tests so that I can verify the correctness of my code and prevent regressions.*

## 3. Tasks

- [ ] Add a unit testing framework to the project.
- [ ] Create example unit tests for a repository.
- [ ] Create example unit tests for a service.
- [ ] Create example unit tests for a UI component.

## 4. Technical Notes & Considerations

- The tests should be able to run independently of the main application.
- The tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 5. Open Questions

- Which testing framework should be used?
