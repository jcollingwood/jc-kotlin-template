## 1. Goal

To establish the foundational structure of the project using Gradle and a simple Kotlin server.

## 2. Description

This involved initializing a Gradle project, setting up the necessary modules, and creating a basic web server in Kotlin to act as the entry point for the application. This setup provides the core framework for building and running the application.

*As a developer, I want a basic Gradle project and a simple Kotlin server so that I can quickly start building and testing new features.*

## 3. Tasks

- [x] Initialize Gradle project
- [x] Configure `settings.gradle.kts` and `build.gradle.kts`
- [x] Create a `server` module with a basic web server
- [x] Establish the initial directory structure (`src/main/kotlin`, `src/main/resources`)

## 4. Technical Notes & Considerations

- The project utilizes Gradle for dependency management and build automation.
- A lightweight Kotlin-based web server was chosen for its performance and ease of use.

## 5. Open Questions

- None
